				<h3>Do I have to be South Asian to join?</h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="row">

						Definitely not! While Delta Phi Omega is a South Asian interest organization, we welcome ladies of all ethnicities. At our colony and establishments all around the nation, we have sisters that are of a variety of cultures and backgrounds. At Delta Phi Omega, we strive to create a sisterhood that is timeless, to aide each other towards personal and organizational success, to help out our local communities as much as we can, to enrich campus life for all with social events, and  to create leadership opportunities for our members. RACE is not a factor of membership!

				What is the difference between traditional Panhellenic Sororities and Multicultural Sororities?</H3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8 col-sm-6">
						The main difference is the focus on culture and diversity. As a multicultural organization, Delta Phi Omega believes in the celebration of different cultures--racial, ethnic, or religious. Another difference is the size of our organizations. Multicultural organizations tend to have smaller chapters/colonies compared to Panhellenic organizations. Delta Phi Omega believes that sisterhood bonds are stronger and shared with everyone as a result of the size of the sisterhood. Our colonies/chapters range from 5 – 45 members at any given time. Lastly, our dues are much less since, majorly speaking, multicultural organizations do not carry the financial burden of maintaining privately owned sorority houses and other large expenses that come with large membership numbers.
