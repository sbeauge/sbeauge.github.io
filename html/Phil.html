					<div class="b">Be The Change</div>
					<br>
					<p>Be The Change is a national annual day of service coordinated to inspire and foster civic engagement and stronger communities through volunteerism and community service. 
					This event was nationally coordinated by SAALT (South Asian Americans Leading Together) until 2016, and has continued to be a part of Delta Phi Omega’s philanthropic efforts. 
					Every year, thousands of participants across the country collectively contribute numerous hours of community service in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi’s famous quote, “Be the change you wish to see in the world.” 
					Be The Change has been an opportunity for South Asian Americans and their allies to engage in collective public service activities that lead to deeper civic engagement, collaboration and unity in localized and national spaces.
					The event presents an opportunity to be connected, be engaged, and be inspired.
					​</p>
					
					<p>On the 2nd Annual Be the Change (Fall 2017), we collaborated with the brothers of the Lambda Chapter of Delta Epsilon Psi South Asian Fraternity, Inc. to volunteer with United Against Poverty organize, sort and help maintain a clean store for the community.

					<div class="b">Our Objective</div>					
					<p>Our paramount objective to bring awareness and continual support to  children's education and literacy. 
					The sisters of Delta Phi Omega are doing their part to ensure that each child is given the power to read and obtain a befitting education, by educating the public on the epidemic of illiteracy, fundraising for our philanthropic partners, and volunteering in literacy and educational settings. 
					This mission has been realized most publicly through the sorority's annual Literacy Through Unity week, a national initiative which to date has risen over $34,000 for children's education and literacy.
					</p>
					<p>At the University of Central Florida colony, the ladies of Delta Phi Omega play an active role in helping our local community. 
					The ladies volunteer their time and are committed to promoting and raising awareness for literacy in their community through community service and activism with the intent and hope of creating a better community for everyone.

					<div class="b">Literacy Through Unity Week</div>
					<p>Every year, we hold an annual “Literacy Through Unity” Week, which is a series of events dedicated to raise awareness about children’s education and literacy. 
					It also aims to raise donations and funds to give to local charitable organizations affiliated with each corresponding chapter or colony, as well as to one of our national beneficiaries which we choose every year. 
					Sisters nationwide help put together Literacy Through Unity Week at their respective chapter or colony to bring communities as well as students together. 
					Events include seminars, donation drives, days of community service, benefit nights at businesses, bake sales, and more. Over the past years, we have been able to raise over $83,000 nationwide. </p>
